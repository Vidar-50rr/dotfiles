title: Linux Packages List
---

`linux/packages.txt` is a curated list of tools to bootstrap a development
machine. It is grouped by purpose:

- Core CLI utilities: `git`, `curl`, `wget`, `rsync`, `zip`, `tar`.
- Shell UX: `bat`, `jq`, `tree`, `yazi (snaps)`, `startship`.
- Dev essentials: `make`, `gcc`, `g++`, `pkg-config`.
- Containers: `docker`, `docker-compose-plugin`.
- Editors/tools: `micro`.
- Java tooling: `sdkman`.

Use this file as a checklist rather than a strict installer. Package names may
vary by distribution.
