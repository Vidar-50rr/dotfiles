## Fonts

Fonts are stored under `fonts/` and used in terminal configurations:

- `fonts/CaskaydiaMonoNerdFont-Regular.ttf`
- `fonts/CaskaydiaMonoNerdFontMono-Regular.ttf`
- `fonts/RedHatMono-Regular.ttf`

Install them on your system to ensure Kitty and Windows Terminal render as
configured.

## Assets

`assets/mr.robot.wallpaper.jpg` is a wallpaper used for personalization.
Use it manually in your desktop environment if desired.
